# Futurustic Car Music System
Imagine RIT project that takes Google DialogueFlow requests through query data passed locally into a Node.js application.  The application establishes a connection to Spotify by sending the Client Id and the Client Secret that is associated with the app.  This request returns an access token that can be used to access Spotify's library and play songs that the user requests.
